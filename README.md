# WILDWOOD

## Overview

Wildwood is a website I made for WordPress. This website integrates a user-friendly interface, allowing visitors to explore and book accommodation and spa treatments. To enhance the site's functionality, I personally coded a bespoke theme using PHP and CSS, ensuring a tailored and responsive design. I have used two Wordpress plugins: Hotel Booking Lite and Easy Appointments to provide functionality.
